## Configuration

Configure folders to display via VS Code settings. Multi-root workspaces are supported—use `${workspaceFolder}` to target every root folder, or `${workspaceFolder:FolderName}` to target a specific one (matching either the workspace folder name or its basename). You can also use `${workspaceFolderName}`, and `${workspaceFolderBasename}` inside `name` values for dynamic labels.

```jsonc
// settings.json
"secondaryExplorer.paths": [
  "${workspaceFolder}/docs",
  "${workspaceFolder:Docs}/guides",

  "${userHome}/notes",
  "${userHome: Notes}/notes",

  "C:/path/to/folder",
  "C:/path/to/folder/file.txt",
  // Or rich objects with filtering and custom name
  {
    "basePath": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "name": "${workspaceFolderName} - Docs",
    "hidden": false, // if true it hides the folder
    "include": ["*.md", "*.txt"], // include: only file patterns
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "build", "out"] // exclude: file or folder patterns
  }
],
"secondaryExplorer.deleteBehavior": "recycleBin", // "alwaysAsk" or "recycleBin" or "permanent"
"secondaryExplorer.rootPathSortOrder": "default", // "default" or "filesFirst" or "foldersFirst" or "mixed"
"secondaryExplorer.itemsSortOrderPattern": [
  "*.instructions.md",
  "*.prompt.md",
  "*.agent.md",
  "*.chatmode.md"
],
```

Example configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "secondaryExplorer.paths": [
    {
      "basePath": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "name": "All Workspace Files",
      "hidden": false,
      "include": ["**/*"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "build", "out", ".vscode-test"],
    },
    {
      "basePath": "${userHome}/repo",
      "name": "${WorkspaceFolderName} Docs",
      "hidden": false,
      "include": ["**/*.{md,markdown,txt,rtf,adoc,asciidoc,restructuredtext,org,html,htm,pdf,docx,odt}"],
      // "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "build", "out"], // Default excludes
    },
    {
      "basePath": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "name": "Workspace Images",
      "hidden": false,
      "include": ["**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg,webp,avif,bmp,tiff,ico,icns,heic,heif}"],
      "exclude": [], // overriding Default excludes.
    },
    {
      "basePath": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "name": "Workspace Tests",
      "hidden": false,
      "include": ["*.test.{js,ts,tsx,jsx}", "*.spec.{js,ts,tsx,jsx}"],
      // "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "build", "out"] // Default excludes
    },
  ],
  "secondaryExplorer.showEmptyDirectories": false, // if true it shows the empty directories
  "secondaryExplorer.deleteBehavior": "alwaysAsk",
  "secondaryExplorer.rootPathSortOrder": "foldersFirst",
  "secondaryExplorer.itemsSortOrderPattern": ["*.instructions.md", "*.prompt.md", "*.agent.md", "*.chatmode.md"],
}
```

**Include/Exclude Logic:**

- `exclude` always takes priority over `include`.
- `include` accepts only file patterns (e.g., `*.md`).
- `exclude` accepts both file and folder patterns (e.g., `node_modules`, `*.log`).
  - By default it exclude `["node_modules", "dist", "build", "out"]`. Set empty list `[]` to include all of these in the tree.

> If you set `include: ["*.md"]` and `exclude: ["node_modules"]`, all Markdown files inside `node_modules` will be excluded from the tree view, even if they match the include pattern.

**Workspace-level configuration recommended.**

- Paths can be absolute or relative (`.`, `..`, `sub/folder`). Relative entries are resolved against each workspace folder, and paths must exist on disk to render.
- Include/Exclude accept glob patterns; include is applied to files, and folders are expanded only if children match include.
- Variable interpolation is supported in string and object forms: ${workspaceFolder}, ${userHome}.
